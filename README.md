## The Real essence of Kumbh Mela

We have discovered that the true essence of Kumbh lies in meeting new people. In ancient times, when communication was limited to letters—neither fast nor easily accessible—people organized public gatherings to share solutions to their problems.

Kumbh, being the largest gathering, was founded on the idea that the most meaningful exchange of knowledge could take place there. People from all over North India could follow any river, eventually converging at a common point to share their learnings and gain wisdom from one another.

To keep this tradition alive, we have built this application to help people connect during Kumbh Mela.
